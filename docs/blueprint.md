## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, energetic purple (#A06CD5). Purple symbolizes ambition and creativity which can attract innovative applicants.
- Background color: A light, desaturated lavender (#F1E5F9). This light background ensures readability and won't distract from the purple accents.
- Accent color: A contrasting pink (#D56CA0) to draw attention to calls to action. This pop of pink against the purple will help guide the user's eye.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability, will be used for all body text to ensure the app is accessible and user-friendly.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font will be used for all headings throughout the app, lending a contemporary, somewhat techy appearance.
- Use a set of modern, outline-style icons to represent different actions and categories. The icons should be simple and easily recognizable to improve the user experience.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth transitions and animations when navigating between pages or when data is loaded. The goal is to add a touch of elegance without overwhelming the user.
